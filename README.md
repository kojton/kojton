## Hi ☺️ 


I'm Kornelia and I identify professionally as both a Data Scientist and a Data Analyst.
I’m currently exploring a wide range of tools and topics through hands-on projects to find my strongest specialization within the data field.
I’m pursuing my Master’s Degree in Big Data – Data Analytics at SGH Warsaw School of Economics.
I’m ambitious, eager to learn, and always ready to take on new challenges.
What I enjoy the most is turning raw data into insights and real business value.
